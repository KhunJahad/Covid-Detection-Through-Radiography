# Covid-Detection-Through-Radiography
This repo is my take on detection of COVID using pretrained network and classifying which X-Ray corresponds to  COVID patients , viral pneumonia and normal . 

The dataset used can be found here -> https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

The training accuracy achieved was -> 97%
And Testing accuracy achieved was -> 70% at the moment 

This repo will be updated till we have achieved good accuracy (certainly more than current ) using various data augmentation techniques and better tunning.
The complete planned project is supposed to have accuracy more than 80% and deployed using flask 
I just a beginner so any suggestions are welcomed.
