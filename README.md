# Covid-Detection-Through-Radiography
This repo is my take on detection of COVID using pretrained network and classifying which X-Ray corresponds to  COVID patients , viral pneumonia and normal . 

The dataset used can be found here -> https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

The training accuracy achieved was -> 97%
And Testing accuracy achieved was -> 70% at the moment 

This repo will be updated till we have achieved good accuracy (certainly more than current ) using various data augmentation techniques and better tunning.
I just want to make clear that it's basically a baseline model as of now .
Well we can't possibly use this model even in completed state in real life testing because data we have is very small. But it is on similar lines to the actual deal and will be accurate for sure for whatever small data we had for our disposal.
I just a beginner so any suggestions are welcomed.
