# Covid-Detection-Through-Radiography
This repo is my take on detection of COVID using pretrained network and classifying which X-Ray corresponds to  COVID patients , viral pneumonia and normal . 

The dataset used can be found here -> https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

And Testing accuracy achieved was -> 97% +  

And this was further tested on two x ray's of my known friend and her mother suffering from viral.
Well we can't possibly use this model even in completed state in real life testing because data we have here is very small. But it is on similar lines to the actual deal and will be accurate for sure for whatever small data we had for our disposal.
I just a beginner so any suggestions are welcomed.
